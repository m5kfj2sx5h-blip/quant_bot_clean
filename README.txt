PRIORITY update 1/22 21:00
>>>>>MUST UPDATE ENTIRE CODE TO USE DECIMALS FOR ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH MONEY!<<<<

THIS STEP MUST BE DONE FIRST BEFORE MOVING FORWARD!


update 1/22
need to rebuild focusing on FUNCTION : PROFITS : FEES
need to adapt and work well in both HIGH and LOW latencies without abusing webskt/REST thresholds
need to seperate/check time sensitive actions & non-critical functions


UPDATE 1/21/26:
1. Check exchangewrappers.py : coinbase advanced need attention? refer to env.TEMPLATE
2. Why am i only seeing buy/sell in USD only?? Why arent we using USDT,USDC and USDT IF AVAILABLE? what ifbwr eun out of USD and all we have left is USDC?
3. arbitrage should be reviewed:
	classic: straightforward, find the best profitable opportunitites (min >=0.5%) accross exchanges for the best pair from : 3 cryotos Btc/Eth/Sol and 3 currencies USD/T/C
	triangular: finds the best profitable opportunities (min>=0.5%) between unlimited pairs/currencies NOT exchanges. basically does what manager/conversion.py does, but for profit!
4. hex arch is not fully implemented. adapters/exchanges need to be redone missing confirmation/rejection messages and in code instructions.

Project Goal & Hexagonal Refactor Instructions”). This captures exactly what we are trying to achieve, stays 100% faithful to your original strategy (no deviations), and gives any future AI the precise context to continue helping you.
## Project Goal & Hexagonal Refactor Instructions

This is a cryptocurrency arbitrage and hedging bot designed for a ~$9,000 budget in January 2026.

### Core Strategy (100% to be preserved)
- **Modes** (switched via macro signals from TradingView):
  - **BTC Mode**: 85% fast arbitrage (cross-exchange + triangular), 15% smart buying/staking.
  - **GOLD Mode**: 85% gold hedging (PAXG), 15% light arbitrage.
- **Arbitrage** (Q-Bot): Buy low / sell high across exchanges or triangular within one exchange. Prefer no-transfer arbs. Only execute if net profit > 0.5% after fees/slippage/transfers.
- **Staking/Accumulation** (A-Bot): Buy on signals, stake for yield, manage up to 6 slots with seat warmers.
- **Gold Hedging/Sweeps** (G-Bot): In GOLD Mode buy PAXG; sweep 15% profits to safe wallet monthly.
- **Money Management**: Keep balances even across exchanges (drift <15%). Use conversion (triangular) before transfer. Prefer cheap/fast networks (Tron/Solana, fees <$1).
- **Risk & Safety**: Depth check (top 5 volume > 2.5–5× trade size), volatility slowdown (double cycle time on high vol), dynamic min-profit threshold (0.4–1% based on auction/market context).
- **Data**: WebSocket-only for prices & order books + short cache. No REST fallback for real-time.
- **Exchanges**: Use official libraries (ccxt for general, krakenex for Kraken, cbpro for Coinbase – leverage Coinbase One zero-fee benefits).

### Current Refactor Goal (Hexagonal Architecture)
We are reorganizing the code into a clean **hexagonal / ports & adapters** structure without changing the strategy, settings, or nomenclature.

- **core/**: Pure domain logic & calculations (no I/O, no external deps):
  - profit.py (net/gross profit, slippage, fees, baseline 0.5%)
  - risk.py (depth check, volatility slowdown)
  - thresholds.py (dynamic 0.4–1% threshold)
  - analysis.py (cvd, wykoff, volume profile, book analysis)
  - auction.py (chase_limit, sizing, iceberg)
  - data_feed.py (WS data + short cache, WS-only)
  - order_executor.py (execution with risk checks)
  - wrappers.py (exchange REST/WS abstraction)

- **domain/**: Pure data types
  - entities.py (Trade, Position, Signal, Mode)
  - values.py (Price, Amount, Symbol, Network – all Decimal)
  - aggregates.py (ArbOpportunity, Balance with drift)

- **manager/** (coordinators – short names): mode.py, money.py, conversion.py, transfer.py, scanner.py, ws.py, signals.py, fees.py, staking.py, health.py

- **ports/**: Interfaces
  - inbound/: signal.py, command.py
  - outbound/: prices.py, books.py, balances.py, execution.py, fees.py, ws.py

- **adapters/**: Real implementations
  - exchanges/: base.py, binance.py (ccxt), kraken.py (krakenex), coinbase.py (cbpro)
  - persistence/: state.py, logs.py

- **bots/**: Q.py, A.py, G.py (slim orchestration)

- **orchestrator.py** (merged main + system_orchestrator.py)

**Prioritized Tweaks** (must be integrated without changing strategy):
1. Baseline 0.5% net profit threshold
2. Dynamic 0.4–1% threshold using auction/market signals
3. Depth check (top 5 volume > 2.5–5× trade size)
4. Volatility slowdown (double cycle time on high range)
5. WebSocket-only for prices/books + short cache
6. Use official Coinbase & Kraken Python libraries

**Rules**:
- Never change the strategy, settings, or existing nomenclature.
- Extract scattered pure functions into core/.
- Use Decimal everywhere for money calculations.
- Keep managers/ and ports/ folders as-is.
- I make all executive decisions — do not write code unless explicitly asked.

Crypto Arbitrage Strategy: Exploiting Market Inefficiencies for Consistent Returns

Executive Summary
In short, while the crypto markets are more efficient than ever, they are nowhere near perfect! The constant introduction of new assets, fragmented nature of exchanges (centralized/decentralized), 24/7 volatility ensure that crypto arbitrage remains a viable strategy… prices of crypto are never the same across exchanges!

This document outlines a comprehensive cryptocurrency arbitrage and hedging strategy designed for a $9,000 budget in January 2026. The system leverages macro signals for mode switching, specialized bots for arbitrage and accumulation, and optimized capital management to minimize operational costs while maximizing net profitability. Key focuses include reducing transfer frequencies through a 15% drift threshold, prioritizing intra-exchange triangular conversions, and selecting the fastest/cheapest stablecoin networks for any necessary cross-account moves.

All components are aligned with 2026 market conditions, drawing from verified sources such as exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Kraken, Coinbase), fee aggregators (e.g., WithdrawalFees.com), and industry guides (e.g., PixelPlex, WunderTrading, CoinAPI). The strategy emphasizes capital efficiency, low-risk execution, and fee minimization to achieve 5–20% annual ROI on small capital.

The system operates in two primary modes based on a custom TradingView signal:

Macro Signal:
	* Fired (BUY BTC/SELL PAXG) on Nov 2023 = BTC Mode
	* Fired another signal on Nov 2025 (SELL BTC/BUY PAXG) = GOLD Mode.

Capital Allocation:
	* BTC Mode: 85% → [[Q-Bot]], 15% → [[A-Bot]], 0% → [[G-Bot]]
	* GOLD Mode: 15% → [[Q-Bot]], 0% → [[A-Bot]], 85% → [[G-Bot]]

System Components
1. [SIGNAL RECEIVER]
	* Always running in the background.
	* Listens for TradingView alerts (macro signal (mode flip) AND A-Bot (buy/sell) signals.
	* When something arrives, it immediately tells the Mode Manager or A-Bot when to buy/sell not what to do.
	* One job: Listens for TradingView alerts and passes them on. No polling, no timing.
2. [MODE MANAGER]
	* Holds the current state: BTC mode or GOLD mode.
	* Only changes when the [SIGNAL RECEIVER] tells it to (from Macro Signal).
	* Tells [MONEY MANAGER] which mode is active now.
	* Activates/deactivates bots DEPENDING on MODE
	* One job: remember the mode and announce/apply changes.
3. [[Q-Bot]]
	* SIMPLE Cross Exchange Arbitrage (80% of Qbot capital) (10s cycles)
	* TRIANGULAR Arbitrage (20% of Qbot Capital) (30s cycles)
	* BOTH:
	    * Run in tight continuous loop (every 10-30s, independent thread).
	    * Subscribes to fast WS data.
	    * Both take advantage of USDT and USDC prices
	    * Uses auction_context & order_executor logic
	    * Scans for arb opportunities (cross/triangular diffs).
	    * Calculates net profit (fees/slippage/transfers).
	    * Executes trades if profitable (limit/market mix, volume profiles, latency).
	    * Always active; uses its allocated capital share.
	    * One job: full arb cycle (scan + execute).
4. [MARKET SCANNER]
	* Compares price and order books to daily candle OHLC
	* Uses market_context logic (CVD, Wykoff, Wale Activity, VolProf)
	* Tells (Qbot when to be aggressive and when to be careful)
	* One job: watch for danger or opportunity in price swings.
5. [MONEY MANAGER]
	* Tracks every penny.
	* Divides the capital.
	* Checks account balances periodically (every few minutes).
	* If money is too uneven between exchanges (>15% drift), signals [TRANSFER MANAGER] AND 	[CONVERSION MANAGER] to move stablecoins to even it out (cheapest way).
	* Maintains a min dynamic BNB balance (logic already done).
	* Tells [TRANSFER MANAGER] AND [CONVERSION MANAGER] what it needs to maintain the ideal 	portfolio proportions across accounts for arbitrage, staking and gold sweeps!
	* One job: prevent capital from getting stuck in one account, divide and protect the 		shared fuel.
6. [CONVERSION MANAGER]
	* It is responsible for all conversions from one form of money to another outside 		triangular arbitrage.
	* It is basically an on demand triangular arbitrage machine with specified pairs and 		finds the cheapest AND fastest routes for the [MONEY MANAGER].
	* It tries to keep the drift across accounts below 15% by intra-exchange triangular 		conversions, so [[Q-bot]] runs smoothly.
	* Does not interrupt arbitrage system
	* One job: Reduces the amount needed to transfer by prioritizing triangular conversions 	(intra-exchange) over any cross-account transfers whenever possible to eliminate 		transfer fees entirely.
7. [TRANSFER MANAGER]
	* Transfers money across accounts after calculating the speed of transfer and transfer 		fees across accounts
	* Receives transfer route from [CONVERSION MANAGER].
	* Does not interrupt arbitrage system
	* Always queries real-time network fees & times, at execution (via exchange API (or 		ccxt)) and select the cheapest + fastest shared network between sender/receiver eg:
	* For Kraken → Binance (USDT): Prefer Tron (TRC-20) or Solana → ~$0.50-1 fee, <5 min.
	* For Binance → Coinbase (USDC): Prefer Solana, Polygon, or Base → <$0.10 fee, <5 min		 (Base often near-instant).
	* Adds safety check: Minimum transfer size $500+ (to avoid dust/minimums; simulate net 		cost (fee + slippage) before transferring).
	* One job: Keep average transfer cost per rebalance <$1 (achievable on above networks), 	ensuring operational costs stay <0.5% of capital annually.
8. [[A-Bot]]
	* Waits idle until [SIGNAL RECEIVER] gives a buy or sell signal.
	* On buy: uses its fuel share to buy the coin on the best exchange and stake it.
	* On sell: sells the coin on the best exchange.
	* If >3 slot is empty, automatically buy the highest-yield stakable coin, (seat warmer).
	* If <2 slot is empty automatically sell the “seat warmer” FIFO..
	* One job: handle the 6 long positions and staking when told.
9. [[G-Bot]]
	* Activates only in GOLD mode (told by Mode Manager).
	* Uses its fuel share to buy PAXG on the best exchange/pair.
	* IF {{MANUAL SWEEP}} is PRESSED during BTC MODE (max frequency, x1 a month), moves 15% 	of total profits to cold wallet in PAXG.
	* On mode flip to BTC, sells 85% of PAXG to free up fuel
	* keeps remaining 15% on a cold wallet
	* every cycle keeps 15%
	* One job: manage gold accumulation and sweeps.

Overall Strategy Notes (Cost-Reduction Emphasis, needs to be finalized)
* For the strategy to work in the real world we must emphasize intra-exchange triangular arbitrage (100% of Q-Bot cycles, ideally) to eliminate cross-account transfers during normal operations—zero transfer fees, full capital efficiency.
* Uses stablecoin pairs (USDT/USDC) on single exchanges with deep liquidity (e.g., Binance for triangular) to maximize 0.2-0.8% net edges without movement costs.
* Never use Ethereum (ERC-20) for transfers under $10k—fees often $0.87-5+ (volatile with congestion), times 5-15+ minutes. Avoid Avalanche unless specifically <$1 confirmed.
* Profitability Boost: By minimizing transfers via higher drift (8%) + low-fee networks, retain ~0.1-0.3% more per opportunity → potential 5-15% higher annual ROI on small capital vs. frequent/high-fee moves.

* For any required transfers, exclusively use the following & verify low-fee/fast stablecoin networks (USDT/USDC only; match sender/receiver support to prevent loss):
    * Tron (TRC-20 for USDT): Fees ~$0.50-1 (often under $1 for $1k equivalent); confirmation time <1-5 minutes. Widely supported on Binance, Kraken, and many others—cheapest consistent option for USDT.
    * Solana: Fees <$0.01-0.10 (frequently near-zero); time <1-5 minutes (near-instant in low congestion). Excellent for both USDT and USDC; high adoption in 2026 for fast arb rebalancing.
    * Polygon (for USDC/USDT): Fees <$0.01-0.50; time <1-5 minutes. Strong for EVM-compatible exchanges; very low and predictable.
    * Base (Coinbase’s L2 for USDC): Fees ~$0.01-0.10; time ~1-2 seconds to near-instant. Ideal for Coinbase endpoints; reduces latency dramatically.
    * BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20 for USDT): Fees ~$0.01-1 (sometimes free on Binance promotions); time <1-5 minutes. Zero or near-zero in many cases.
* Never use Ethereum (ERC-20) for transfers under $10k—fees often $0.87-5+ (volatile with congestion), times 5-15+ minutes. Avoid Avalanche unless specifically <$1 confirmed.

Summary: Prioritized Tweaks to Implement (Keep Strategy 100% Intact)
1. Set baseline threshold to 0.5% net (add to calculate_net_profit or config).
2. Make it dynamic (0.4–1% range) using auction/market context signals (highest ROI impact).
3. Add depth check (top 5 volume > 2.5–5× trade size) before execution.
4. Volatility slowdown (double cycle time on high range).
5. Reinforce WebSocket-only for prices/books + short cache
6. Coinbase & kraken have their own python libraries.
